Project Title: Years to Days Converter

Description: This is an age calculator that calculates how many days old you are.

Languages used: Java

For this project, I used two files: AgeCalc.java and TextIO.java.

AgeCalc.java- The user is asked for their name and age. Then, they take the user's
age and turns it to days.

TextIO.java- this is just used to get the user input at certain points of the
program.

To run this project, compile the AgeCalc.java file and run it in the
terminal.
